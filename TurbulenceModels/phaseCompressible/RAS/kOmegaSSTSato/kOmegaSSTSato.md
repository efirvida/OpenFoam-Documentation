## Description
Implementation of the k-omega-SST turbulence model for dispersed bubbly
flows with Sato (1981) bubble induced turbulent viscosity model.

Bubble induced turbulent viscosity model described in:

        International Journal of Multiphase FLow 7, pp. 167-177, 1981.

Turbulence model described in:

with the addition of the optional F3 term for rough walls from
```

        "Some Improvements in Menterâ€™s k-omega-SST turbulence model"
        29th AIAA Fluid Dynamics Conference,
        AIAA-98-2554,
        June 1998.
```

Note that this implementation is written in terms of alpha diffusion
coefficients rather than the more traditional sigma (alpha = 1/sigma) so
that the blending can be applied to all coefficuients in a consistent
manner.  The paper suggests that sigma is blended but this would not be
consistent with the blending of the k-epsilon and k-omega models.

Also note that the error in the last term of equation (2) relating to
sigma has been corrected.

Wall-functions are applied in this implementation by using equations (14)
to specify the near-wall omega as appropriate.

The blending functions (15) and (16) are not currently used because of the
uncertainty in their origin, range of applicability and that is y+ becomes
sufficiently small blending u_tau in this manner clearly becomes nonsense.

The default model coefficients correspond to the following:
```
        kOmegaSSTCoeffs
        {
            alphaK1     0.85034;
            alphaK2     1.0;
            alphaOmega1 0.5;
            alphaOmega2 0.85616;
            Prt         1.0;    // only for compressible

            beta2       0.0828;

        }
