# mapAddedPolyMesh 
## Class
Foam::mapAddedPolyMesh

## Description
Class containing mesh-to-mesh mapping information after a mesh addition
where we add a mesh ('added mesh') to an old mesh, creating a new mesh.

We store mapping from the old to the new mesh and from the added mesh
to the new mesh.

Note: Might need some more access functions or maybe some zone maps?
