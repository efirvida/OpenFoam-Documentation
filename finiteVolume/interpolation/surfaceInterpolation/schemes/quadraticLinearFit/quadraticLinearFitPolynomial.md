## Class
Foam::quadraticLinearFitPolynomial

## Description
Quadratic/linear polynomial for interpolation fitting:
        quadratic normal to the face,
        linear in the plane of the face for consistency with 2nd-order Gauss.

Can be used with the CentredFit scheme to create a quadratic surface
interpolation scheme
