# cellModel 
## Class
Foam::cellModel

## Description
Maps a geometry to a set of cell primitives, which enables
geometric cell data to be calculated without access to the primitive
geometric level.  This means mapping a 3D geometry to a set of
pyramids which are each described by a cell face and the cell centre
point.
