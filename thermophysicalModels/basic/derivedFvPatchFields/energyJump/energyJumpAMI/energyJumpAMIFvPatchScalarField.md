# energyJumpAMIFvPatchScalarField 
## Class
Foam::energyJumpAMIFvPatchScalarField

## Group
grpThermoBoundaryConditions grpCoupledBoundaryConditions

## Description
This boundary condition provides an energy jump condition across a pair
of coupled patches with an arbitrary mesh interface (AMI).  It is not
applied directly, but is employed on-the-fly when converting temperature
boundary conditions into energy.
