# PaSR.T 
## Class
Foam::combustionModels::PaSR

## Description
Partially stirred reactor combustion model.  The model calculates a finite
rate, based on both turbulence and chemistry time scales.  Depending on
mesh resolution, the Cmix parameter can be used to scale the turbulence
mixing time scale.
