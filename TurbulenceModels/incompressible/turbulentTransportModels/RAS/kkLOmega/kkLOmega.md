## Description
Low Reynolds-number k-kl-omega turbulence model for
incompressible flows.

This turbulence model is described in:
```
        Walters, D. K., & Cokljat, D. (2008).
        A three-equation eddy-viscosity model for Reynolds-averaged
        Navierâ€“Stokes simulations of transitional flow.
        Journal of Fluids Engineering, 130(12), 121401.
```

however the paper contains several errors which must be corrected for the
model to operation correctly as explained in

```
        Furst, J. (2013).
        Numerical simulation of transitional flows with laminar kinetic energy.
        Engineering MECHANICS, 20(5), 379-388.
```

All these corrections and updates are included in this implementation.

The default model coefficients are
