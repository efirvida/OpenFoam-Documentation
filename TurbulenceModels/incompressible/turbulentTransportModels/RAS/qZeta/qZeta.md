## Description
Gibson and Dafa'Alla's q-zeta two-equation low-Re turbulence model
for incompressible flows

This turbulence model is described in:
```
        Dafa'Alla, A.A., Juntasaro, E. & Gibson, M.M. (1996).
        Calculation of oscillating boundary layers with the
        q-zeta turbulence model.
        Engineering Turbulence Modelling and Experiments 3:
        Proceedings of the Third International Symposium,
        Crete, Greece, May 27-29, 141.
```
which is a development of the original q-zeta model described in:
```
        Gibson, M. M., & Dafa'Alla, A. A. (1995).
        Two-equation model for turbulent wall flow.
        AIAA journal, 33(8), 1514-1518.
